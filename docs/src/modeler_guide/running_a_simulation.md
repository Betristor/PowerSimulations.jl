# [Simulation](@id running_a_simulation)

!!! tip "Always try to solve the operations problem first before putting together the simulation"
    It is not uncommon that when trying to solve a complex simulation the resulting models are infeasible. This situation can be the result of many factors like the input data, the incorrect specification of the initial conditions for models with time dependencies or a poorly specified model. Therefore, it's highly recommended to run and analyze an [Operations Problems](@ref psi_structure) that reflect the problems that will be included in a simulation prior to executing a simulation.
