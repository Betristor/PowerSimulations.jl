# Operations Problem Templates

Templates are used to specify the modeling properties of the devices and network that are going to he used
to specify a problem. `PowerSimulations.jl` allows the user to specify the formulations of every device independently
such that the modeler can adjust the level of detail according to the question of interest and in many cases to the available data

`PowerSimulations.jl` provides default templates for common operation problems. You can retrieve a default template and modify it according
to your requirements.
