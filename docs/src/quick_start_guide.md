# Quick Start Guide

PowerSystems.jl is structured to enable data creation scripts, flexible interfaces for data
intake and extension of the data model. These features are enabled through three main features:

- [Abstract type hierarchy](@ref type_structure),
- Optimized read/write data container (the container is called [`System`](@ref)),
- Utilities to facilitate modeling, extensions, and integration.

You can access example data in the [Power Systems Test Data Repository](https://github.com/NREL-SIIP/PowerSystemsTestData),
the data can be downloaded with the submodule `UtilsData`
